# kujaw-et-config
!kujaw's config to Wolfenstein Enemy Territory: Legacy 

I'd like to make this config for newcomers who want to participate with experienced players. Feel free to add new ideas, share and use.

To use it just copy all files to your etlegacy mod folder. ET loads autoexec.cfg file automatically, autoexec.cfg loads other files.
