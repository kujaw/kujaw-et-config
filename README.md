# kujaw-et-config
!kujaw's config to Wolfenstein Enemy Territory: Legacy 

I'd like to make this config for newcomers who want to participate with experienced players. Feel free to add new ideas, share and use.

To use it just copy both autoexec.cfg and kujaw-config.cfg to your etmain, etpro or etlegacy directory. ET loads autoexec.cfg file automatically.
